Joseph Schiarizzi

## American.
I'm an American, I believe America is the greatest country in the world.
I love my family, I'm the first person in my family to go to college, and I grew up being told that if I work hard I can achieve success.

## Innovative.
Last year I won a research prize for my sustainable server cluster scheduling
Building sustainable infrastructure is something worth doing that I'm passionate about.

## BUILD
Individuals have the power to change the world.  It starts with curiosity and learning how to build.
Here are some of the things I've built this year: 3d Printer, my computer, cool LED things

## Hackital
Most of my time goes to [Hackital](hackital.io), a hackathon in the capital.
